title: "Notifications Setting"

Notifications inform users about events, changes, and actions across the platform. Any meaningful state change, system event, or user-facing action generates a notification, subject to notification rules and user preferences.

Notifications are designed to support:

- Awareness (what changed)
- Accountability (who triggered it)
- Traceability (when and where it happened)
- Actionability (what the user should do next, if anything)

## **Notification Delivery and Visibility**

### **In-app notifications**

- All notifications are surfaced through the bell icon in the main header.
- The bell icon displays an unread count badge.
- Clicking the bell opens a notification list, ordered by most recent first.
- Each notification item includes:
  - Notification title
  - Short description
  - Timestamp
  - Related object reference (project, file, task, subscription, etc.)
  - Read / unread state

Clicking a notification navigates the user to the relevant page or opens a contextual view with full details.

### **External notifications**

Depending on user preferences and notification type, notifications may also be delivered via:
- Email
- SMS

External delivery mirrors in-app content but may be summarized for clarity and deliverability.

## **Notification Management**

Users can manage notification preferences from **Profile** → **Notifications**.

Configurable options include:
- Enable or disable notification categories
- Choose delivery channels per category:
  - In-app
  - Email
  - SMS
- Set frequency rules where applicable (immediate vs digest, if supported)

### **Mandatory notifications**

Some notifications are mandatory and cannot be disabled or redirected. These are enforced to ensure platform integrity, security, and legal or operational compliance.

Examples:
- Global notices (in-app only)
- Critical security alerts
- Account integrity events

**Note:** Mandatory notifications are clearly labeled in settings and cannot be modified by the user.

## **Types of Notifications**

### **1. Security and Authentication**

Triggered by events related to account access and security posture.

Examples:
- Login from a new device or location
- Password change
- Two-factor authentication events
- Failed login attempts
- Session termination due to security rules

**Note:** These notifications are often mandatory and prioritized.

### **2. Global Notices**

Platform-wide announcements and system-level messages.

Examples:

These notifications support operational awareness and auditability.
