## What is a Vendor?

A vendor is a company, organization, or institution that provides Survey files or data services as part of the information collection process. Vendors play a crucial role in supplying datasets, tools, or resources necessary for research, analysis, and decision-making. They may specialize in collecting, processing, and distributing data or provide software and technologies, such as Survey, to facilitate data analysis. In some cases, vendors may also assist with data management, quality assurance, and compliance with data privacy regulations.

## **How to Add One?**
There are two primary methods to add a vendor to the system:

1. Directly from the Vendors section.  
2. During the data entry process (Wizard 3 in General Data Entry).


### **1- Directly from the Vendor Section**
The vendor section is accessible from the main navigation menu and is the third section in the heading. To add a new vendor:

1. Navigate to the [Vendors](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/vendors) section in the data provider.
2. Click the blue **New Vendor** button located in the top-right corner.

</Frame>

Once you click the button, a new page will appear where you can input the vendor’s information.

Complete the vendor profile, which consists of 8 wizards. Each wizard corresponds to a specific set of information, such as:

* Institution’s name  
  * Social media accounts  
  * Address  
  * Contact details  
  * Additional relevant information

## **Finding a Vendor**

To quickly locate an existing vendor, in the [Vendors](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/vendors) page, use the **Institution Name** filter:

1. Type part or all of the vendor’s institution name in the search bar.  
2. The system will display matching results, making it easy to find the vendor you need.

## **Summary**

Understanding how to manage vendors in your system ensures efficient handling of data services and resources. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily add or locate vendors, streamlining your data collection and management process.

To access a vendor's profile, you can choose one of the following methods:

1. **Search for the Vendor Name in VoxDash**: Utilize the search functionality in VoxDash by entering the vendor's name. This will quickly locate the vendor's profile, allowing you to view detailed information.  
2. **Click on the Vendor’s Name in the Data Project**: Within the data project, locate and click on the vendor’s name. This will directly take you to their profile page, where you can review associated details and insights.

Both approaches will provide comprehensive access to the vendor’s profile, including key details such as contact information, transaction history, performance metrics, and any relevant documents or associated data.
