## **Data Profiles**

Creating a **Data profile** is the process of examining, analyzing, and summarizing data to identify trends, quality issues, and potential risks. This helps to gain high-level insight into data quality and integrity. Completing a data profile is crucial for:

* Identifying data quality issues  
* Spotting potential risks  
* Recognizing overall data trends

These insights can guide companies in improving decision-making, optimizing operations, and ensuring the integrity of their data. You can view all this information in the [Data Profiles Section](https://www.voxdash.com/individual/2148/dataProfile)
