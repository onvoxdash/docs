title: "Request Management" 
---

Request Management governs how users request permission to access restricted data projects, questions, or files, and how data providers review and manage those requests.
This mechanism applies platform-wide and enforces controlled access without exposing analytical details or downloadable assets by default.

## **Preconditions for Access Requests**

Users are allowed to submit an access request only under **both** of the following logical conditions.

### **Condition 1:** Public but Restricted Data
A data project, question, or file is marked as **publicly visible**, but one or more of the following restrictions apply:
 - Downloads are disabled
 - Analytical details are hidden
 - Full metadata or results are not accessible

In this state, users can browse high-level information but cannot interact with the data in a meaningful way.

### **Condition 2:** Catalog Visibility Granted by Admin

The data provider has explicitly granted the user **catalog visibility** (for example, via organization-level or user-level access), but has not granted full access rights.
Catalog access allows discovery, **not** usage.


## **User Side Flow**

### **Restricted View State**

When either condition applies:

- Users can see the data listing
- Users cannot:
 - Download files
 - View analytical outputs
 - Access detailed results or breakdowns

A **Request Access** button is displayed.

### **Request Access Steps**

**1. Initiate Request**

- User clicks the **Request Access** button on the relevant data project, question, or file.

**2. Provide Contact Details**

- User enters one or more email addresses that should receive access if approved.

- Multiple emails are allowed to support team-based access requests.

**3.Add Request Message**

- User writes a short explanation or justification for the request.

- This message is visible to the data provider admin and is used for review and clarification.

**4.Submit Request**

Upon submission:

 - The request is recorded in the system
 - A notification is sent to the relevant admin(s)
 - The request enters a Pending state

### **Request Outcome Notifications**

After admin review:

- If **approved**:
 - User receives a notification
 - Access is granted according to the admin’s decision scope

- If **rejected**:
 - User receives a notification
 - No access is granted

- Notifications appear:
 - In the platform notification center
 - On the specific data item where access was requested
