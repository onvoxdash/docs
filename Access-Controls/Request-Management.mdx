title: "Managing Data Access Requests (Provider Guide)" 
---

When you restrict a dataset, users cannot view full records, analytics, or downloads until you approve them.
Instead, they submit an access request explaining why they need the data. You then evaluate the request and grant an appropriate permission level.

This helps you:
* Protect sensitive business information
* Share data safely with partners or clients
* Maintain auditability of who accessed what
* Enforce internal compliance policies

You always retain control — access can be approved, limited, or revoked at any time.

## Understanding Access Levels

When approving a request, you assign a permission level.
Choose the lowest level that still allows the user to perform their task.

| Access Level   | What the User Can Do                  | Typical Use Case                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**      | Full management and sharing rights    | Internal team lead or dataset maintainer |
| **Downloader** | Export or download raw data           | External analysts, BI integration        |
| **Analyst**    | Use dashboards and analytics only     | Marketing or performance review          |
| **Viewer**     | Read-only preview of detailed records | Vendor or partner verification           |

**Recommendation:** Avoid granting Owner access to external organizations unless required.

## Accessing Request Management

Go to:

**Data Provider → Request Management**

This section centralizes **all requests across every dataset you manage**.
You do not need to open individual projects to review permissions.

**What You See**

* All pending incoming requests
* Previously approved users
* Rejected attempts
* Active access holders

### Request Information Panel

Contains:

* Dataset name
* Dataset type
* Requesting user account
* Submitted email addresses
* Justification message
* Custom form responses
* Submission timestamp
* Current status

### Status Meanings

| Status   | Meaning                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Pending  | Awaiting provider action      |
| Approved | User currently has access     |
| Rejected | Access denied                 |
| Revoked  | Access removed after approval |

## Configure Required Request Information

You can require users to submit specific information before requesting access.
This ensures you receive enough context to make a decision without repeated back-and-forth messaging.

### How It Works

Before the request form appears to users, they must fill in the fields you define.

### Recommended Fields

| Field                  | Why It Matters                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Company / Organization | Verify business legitimacy    |
| Intended Use           | Prevent misuse                |
| Project Name           | Connect request to real work  |
| Duration of Access     | Temporary vs permanent        |
| Legal Agreement        | Compliance or NDA requirement |

## Reviewing a Request

Open any request to view full details, and decide whether to grant access or reject it.

## Communicating With Users

Each request includes a built-in conversation thread. You can ask for more information before giving an access.

### When to Use Chat
* The request purpose is unclear
* The user selected the wrong access level
* You need confirmation of business relationship
* You must explain compliance requirements

</Frame> 

**Example Questions to Ask**

* “Will you export the data or only analyze dashboards?”
* “Is this for internal reporting or client delivery?”
* “How long do you need access?”

**Tip:** Asking one clarification question often avoids granting excessive permissions.

Messages remain attached to the request for audit tracking.

## Approving Requests

To grant access:

1. Open the request
2. Select permission level
3. Click **Approve**

**What Happens Automatically:**
* Status changes to **Approved**
* Permissions activate immediately
* User receives notification
* Dataset becomes visible based on role
* Action recorded in audit history

## Rejecting Requests

Reject a request when:
* The use case conflicts with data policy
* The organization is unknown
* The purpose is vague or suspicious
* Legal agreements are missing

### Steps

1. Open request
2. Click **Reject**
3. Provide optional explanation
   * Status changes to **Rejected**
   * User is notified
   * Dataset remains hidden
   * Action logged for record keeping

**Best practice:** Always explain rejections. It reduces repeat requests.

## Revoking Previously Approved Access

Access permissions are not permanent.
You should periodically review and remove outdated permissions.

### Common Reasons
* Contract or partnership ended
* Employee left the company
* Project completed
* Security policy update
* Incorrect approval level

### Steps

1. Open approved request
2. Click **Remove Access**

### Immediate Effects

* User loses access instantly
* Analytics and downloads disabled
* Status updated to **Revoked**
* Event logged in history

## Filtering and Managing Requests

As the number of incoming access requests grows, efficient filtering becomes essential.
The filtering tools in the left sidebar allow you to quickly locate, review, and manage specific requests without manually scanning the entire list.

Using filters helps you:

* Prioritize urgent approvals
* Monitor sensitive datasets
* Audit user access
* Maintain clean permission control

</Frame> 

Below are the available filters and how to use them effectively.

### 1. Status Filter

Filter requests based on their current state:

* Pending → Requires action
* Approved → Review periodically
* Rejected → Audit attempts

### 2. Data Project Filter

Use this filter to display requests related to a specific project or dataset.

This is especially useful when:
* A project contains sensitive or high-value data
* You manage multiple projects across departments
* You need to audit access for a specific initiative

It is also useful when you manage multiple products:
* Projects
* Questions
* Files
* Vendor datasets

### 3. Email Filter

Filter by submitted email address(es) to find:
* All requests from a specific organization
* Multiple requests tied to the same domain
* Duplicate or repeated access attempts

This is particularly helpful when:
* A company has several employees requesting access
* You need to verify consistency in permission levels
* You are auditing external partner access

### 4. Date Filter

Filter requests by submission date or recency.

Use this filter to:
* Review newly submitted requests
* Identify old pending requests
* Conduct periodic permission audits
* Monitor recent approval activity

### 5. Name Filter

Filter by the requesting user's name.

This allows you to:
* Locate all requests from a specific individual
* Review access history before granting additional permissions
* Track activity related to key stakeholders

This filter is particularly useful when:
* A user changes roles
* You need to revoke or upgrade permissions
* You are reviewing access during compliance checks

## Best Practices for Secure Data Sharing

* Require justification fields
* Prefer Analyst over Downloader
* Communicate before rejecting unclear requests
* Never grant permanent external Owner access
* Revoke access after project completion
* Document approvals through chat

This workflow ensures your platform remains collaborative while maintaining strict data governance and compliance.
