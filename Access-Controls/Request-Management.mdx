title: "Request Management" 
---

Request Management governs how users request permission to access restricted data projects, questions, or files, and how data providers review and manage those requests.
This mechanism applies platform-wide and enforces controlled access without exposing analytical details or downloadable assets by default.

## **Preconditions for Access Requests**

Users are allowed to submit an access request only under **both** of the following logical conditions.

### **Condition 1:** Public but Restricted Data
A data project, question, or file is marked as **publicly visible**, but one or more of the following restrictions apply:
  - Downloads are disabled
  - Analytical details are hidden
  - Full metadata or results are not accessible

In this state, users can browse high-level information but cannot interact with the data in a meaningful way.

### **Condition 2:** Catalog Visibility Granted by Admin

The data provider has explicitly granted the user **catalog visibility** (for example, via organization-level or user-level access), but has not granted full access rights.
Catalog access allows discovery, **not** usage.


## **User Side Flow**

### **Restricted View State**

When either condition applies:

- Users can see the data listing
- Users cannot:
  - Download files
  - View analytical outputs
  - Access detailed results or breakdowns

A **Request Access** button is displayed.

### **Request Access Steps**

**1. Initiate Request**

- User clicks the **Request Access** button on the relevant data project, question, or file.

**2. Provide Contact Details**

- User enters one or more email addresses that should receive access if approved.

- Multiple emails are allowed to support team-based access requests.

**3.Add Request Message**

- User writes a short explanation or justification for the request.

- This message is visible to the data provider admin and is used for review and clarification.

**4.Submit Request**

Upon submission:

 - The request is recorded in the system
 - A notification is sent to the relevant admin(s)
 - The request enters a Pending state

### **Request Outcome Notifications**

After admin review:

- If **approved**:
  - User receives a notification
  - Access is granted according to the admin’s decision scope

- If **rejected**:
  - User receives a notification
  - No access is granted

- Notifications appear:
  - In the platform notification center
  - On the specific data item where access was requested

## **Admin Side Flow**

### **Request Management Section**

Admins with the appropriate permissions can access the **Request Management** section within the data provider area.

This section aggregates **all access requests across the platform**, regardless of data type.

### **Admin Capabilities**

For each request, admins can:

**1. Review Request Details**
  - Requested data item
  - Requesting user
  - Submitted email(s)
  - User’s request message
  - Request status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

**2.Communicate with Users**

Use the built-in chat to:
  -Ask for clarification
  -Request additional context
  -Explain decisions

**3.Approve Requests**

- Grant access based on internal policies
- Approval changes the request state and enables access

**4.Reject Requests**
- Deny access explicitly
-User is notified of the rejection

**5.Revoke Previously Approved Access**
- Admins can revoke access that was approved earlier
- Revocation immediately removes granted permissions
- The request state is updated accordingly

### **Filtering and Management Tools**

Admins can use **left-sidebar filters** to manage requests efficiently, such as:
- Request status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Data type (project, question, file)
- Requesting user
- Date or recency

These filters are intended to support high-volume request environments.

## **Notes and Enforcement**

- Access is never automatic. Visibility does not imply permission.
- All access decisions are auditable through request records.
- Revocation is treated as a first-class action, not an exception.
- The system is designed for controlled sharing, not blanket access.
