title: "Requesting Access to Restricted Data"
---

Some datasets in the platform can be previewed but not fully explored or downloaded.
For example, you may be able to open a project page, view summary information, or see sample records — but analytics, exports, or detailed fields remain restricted.

To work with this data, you must request access from the data provider.

Restricted items may include:
* Projects
* Questions / surveys
* Vendors or suppliers
* Reports
* Any dataset limited by the provider’s permissions

## Step 1: Submit an Access Request

**1.** Navigate to the page containing the data you want to access.

**2.** Click **Request Access**.

A request form will appear.

### Provide Contact Information

Enter the details the provider will use to evaluate your request:
* Your name
* Your email address
* Additional email addresses (optional)

**Tip:** Add teammates’ emails if multiple people need access. All listed emails will receive the approval notification.

### Explain Your Request

Write a short explanation describing:
* How you plan to use the data
* The business purpose (analysis, partnership, research, etc.)
* Any relevant project or company context

Good requests are more likely to be approved.

## Step 2: Track Requests in User Central

You can manage all your access requests in **User Central → Access**.

This page contains a table listing every dataset you have requested.

For each request you can see:
* Current status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
* Dataset name
* Access level granted
* Request date

## Step 3: Communicate with the Provider

Each request includes a built-in chat.

Use it to:
* Clarify your use case
* Answer provider questions
* Request additional permissions
* Share context or documents

**Important:** Providers often approve requests faster when communication is clear.

## Step 4 — After Approval

Once approved:
* You will receive a notification email
* The dataset becomes available in the platform
* New analytics and download options appear automatically

Your access level may vary:

| Access Level | What You Can Do          |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Viewer       | View detailed records    |
| Catalog      | View basic information   |
| Downloader   | Download data            |
| Owner        | All permissions          |


## Messages Tab (Direct Contact)

You can also contact providers directly from **Messages**.

Use this when:
* You have general questions before requesting access
* You need help understanding a dataset
* You want to discuss partnership or collaboration

## Best Practices for Approval

To improve approval chances:

* Be specific about your use case
* Mention business relevance
* Keep requests professional and concise
* Communicate through the chat if clarification is requested
