## **Public Access Levels**

The public access levels you configure affect how your data is shared and interacted with on VoxDash. These levels apply to all visitors, not specific users. The options include:
* **Public or Private**: Determines whether the presence of the data in VoxDash is visible to all users.  
* **Searchable in VoxDash**: Controls whether the data can be found using the VoxDash search feature.  
* **Indexable in Search Engines**: Allows or restricts external search engines (like Google) from indexing the data.  
* **Content Access**: Specifies whether all data content is viewable but not downloadable by all users in VoxDash. This option is only available if your file type is supported by VoxDash for this feature.   
* **Downloadable Content**: Determines if the data is both viewable and downloadable by all users in VoxDash.  
* **Indexable in AI**: Allows or restricts AI bots (like ChatGPT) from indexing the data.

## **Additional Information**

### **Impact of Public Access**
When enabling Public Access, carefully consider the type of data being shared. Public access is ideal for open data initiatives, public reports, or collaborative projects where wide accessibility is a priority. For proprietary or sensitive data, opt for restricted access or user-based permissions to safeguard confidentiality.

### **Audit and Manage Public Access**
You can revisit and adjust public access settings at any time by following the steps outlined above. Regularly review these settings to ensure they comply with your current security and sharing requirements.

### **Who Can Edit Public Access?**
Editing public access settings is typically restricted to users with **administrative privileges** or specific **project permissions**. If you do not see the editing options, reach out to your **project administrator** for assistance.

By following this guide and understanding the various public access options, you can effectively manage the visibility, security, and accessibility of your data projects. Adjust the settings to align with your sharing needs and privacy policies, ensuring optimal control over your projectâ€™s exposure.
