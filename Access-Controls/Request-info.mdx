In some cases, data may be publicly visible on the platform, but the provider requires additional information from users before granting full access.

When this requirement is enabled, a **Request Info** modal appears before the user can view or interact with the data.

This process allows providers to:

* Collect important user details
* Understand the intended use of the data
* Maintain data governance and compliance
* Reduce unnecessary back-and-forth communication

## When Does the Request Info Modal Appear?

The modal appears when:
* A dataset is publicly listed but requires user information before access
* A provider has configured mandatory information fields
* The user attempts to open or view restricted content within a public dataset

The user must complete the required fields before proceeding.

## Email Options

Within the Request Info Modal, users must provide an email address. There are two possible options:

### Verified Email

This is an email address that:
* Has already been verified within the platform
* Is associated with the user’s account
* Has completed email confirmation during registration

Using a verified email ensures:

* Higher trust and credibility
* Faster approval (if manual review is required)
* Accurate tracking within the system

### Regular Email

This is an email address that:
* Has not been verified on the platform
* May be different from the user’s primary account email
* Is provided temporarily for access purposes

Users may choose this option if:
* They want to use a company email instead of a personal one
* They are accessing data on behalf of another department
* They need notifications sent to a different address

**Note:** Providers may treat verified emails as more reliable during evaluation.

## Custom Information Fields

Providers can configure additional fields in the Request Info Modal.

Examples include:
* Company name
* Job title
* Intended use of data
* Project name
* Access duration
* Legal agreement confirmation

If the required field is not available in the default list, providers can create custom fields tailored to their needs.

This flexibility allows organizations to:
* Collect compliance-related information
* Qualify potential partners
* Filter non-serious requests

## Where Submitted Information Appears

All submitted information is stored and displayed in the **File Manager table** (or corresponding data management table).

Providers can view:
* User details
* Selected email type
* Custom field responses
* Submission date

This information remains accessible for review and auditing.

## Editing Configuration

Providers can modify Request Info Modal settings at any time.

You can:
* Add or remove required fields
* Change which email types are allowed
* Update field requirements
* Adjust validation rules

Changes apply to future access attempts. Previously submitted information remains unchanged in the system records.

## Best Practices
* Require verified emails for sensitive datasets.
* Keep forms concise to improve completion rates.
* Add only necessary fields to reduce friction.
* Use custom fields for compliance or partnership qualification.

The Request Info Modal ensures that even publicly listed data can be accessed responsibly, while maintaining transparency, traceability, and efficient communication between users and providers.
