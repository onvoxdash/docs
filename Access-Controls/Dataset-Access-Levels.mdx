## Dataset Access Levels

Dataset access levels define how users interact with datasets published on the platform. As a data provider, you can configure access restrictions to ensure compliance, protect sensitive ecommerce data, and maintain full traceability of user activity.

Access levels allow you to control:

- Whether users must accept Terms and Conditions
- Whether users must submit additional information
- Whether identity verification is required
- Whether provider approval is required before access
- How dataset usage is logged and audited

Each dataset must be assigned one of five access levels. The selected level determines the user journey before access is granted.

All access requests, approvals, and confirmations are logged automatically to ensure transparency, compliance, and audit readiness.

## Overview of Access Levels

| Level | Name | User Confirmation | Additional Info Required | Email Verification | Provider Approval |
|-------|------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Passive Terms | No | No | No | No |
| 2 | Explicit Acceptance | Yes | No | No | No |
| 3 | Acceptance + Provider Information | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| 4 | Acceptance + Information + Verified Email | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| 5 | Controlled Access (Request & Approval) | Yes | Optional | Optional | Yes |

## Level 1 – Passive Terms and Implicit Agreement (Default)

Level 1 is the default access configuration for newly created datasets.

### How it works

Each dataset includes:

- Provider-defined Terms and Conditions
- A dataset-specific contract

These documents are permanently visible under the [Contract](https://www.voxdash.com/data/4408/contract) tab on the dataset page. Users can review and download them at any time.

At this level:

- Users are not required to actively accept the terms
- Access to the dataset is immediate
- No additional user input is required

### When to use Level 1

Level 1 is appropriate for:

- Public ecommerce datasets
- Open analytics dashboards
- Non-sensitive product or catalog data
- Freely accessible benchmark datasets

This level provides maximum accessibility while maintaining transparency through visible legal documentation.

## Level 2 – Explicit Acceptance Required

Level 2 introduces mandatory user acknowledgment before access is granted.

### How it works

Before accessing the dataset, users must:

1. Review the Terms and Conditions
2. Explicitly confirm acceptance (e.g., checkbox confirmation)
3. Submit an access request

Access is granted automatically after acceptance.

Unlike Level 1, access is not immediate until the user confirms agreement.

### When to use Level 2

Level 2 is recommended for:

- Licensed ecommerce datasets
- Internal company datasets
- Data requiring legal acknowledgment
- Usage-restricted analytical reports

This level ensures documented user consent without increasing operational complexity.

## Level 3 – Explicit Acceptance + Provider Information

Level 3 builds on Level 2 by requiring users to submit additional information defined by the data provider.

### How it works

To gain access, users must:

1. Accept the Terms and Conditions
2. Complete a provider-defined information form
3. Submit the request

Access is granted once both steps are completed.

### Provider-Defined Information May Include:

- Organization or affiliation
- Job title or role
- Intended use of data
- Business use case
- Research purpose
- Funding source
- Geographic region of use
- Any structured compliance declaration

### Why use Level 3?

Level 3 is suitable when:

- Dataset usage must be tracked by organization
- Commercial ecommerce insights require usage transparency
- Regulatory reporting is required
- You need contextual information about how the data will be used

This level improves governance while keeping the process automated.

## Level 4 – Acceptance + Provider Information + Verified Email

Level 4 adds identity verification on top of Level 3 requirements.

### How it works

Users must complete three steps:

1. Accept Terms and Conditions
2. Submit provider-required information
3. Verify their email address via OTP (One-Time Password)

Access is granted only after successful verification.

### Why email verification matters

Email verification ensures:

- Valid and traceable user identity
- Reduced fraudulent access
- Stronger compliance enforcement
- Reliable communication channel for audits or updates

### When to use Level 4

Recommended for:

- Commercial ecommerce transaction datasets
- Customer-level anonymized analytics
- High-value business intelligence data
- Partner-only shared datasets

Level 4 provides enhanced security without requiring manual approval.

## Level 5 – Controlled Access (Request and Approval)

Level 5 is the most restrictive access configuration and provides full provider control.

### How it works

Users must:

1. Accept Terms and Conditions
2. Submit required information (if configured)
3. Complete email verification (if configured)
4. Submit an access request

Access is granted only after manual review and approval by the data provider.

There is no automatic access at this level.

### When to use Level 5

Level 5 is recommended for:

- Sensitive ecommerce transaction data
- Confidential business intelligence reports
- Commercially licensed datasets
- Regulatory-restricted datasets
- Private research collaborations

This level ensures that access is fully controlled and documented.

## Audit and Compliance

For all access levels:

- All acceptance actions are logged
- Access timestamps are recorded
- Approval decisions (if applicable) are tracked
- User-submitted information is stored securely
- Email verification status is logged

These logs support:

- Compliance audits
- Legal traceability
- Internal governance policies
- Regulatory reporting requirements

## Best Practices for Data Providers

- Use Level 1 for open datasets.
- Use Level 2 when legal acknowledgment is required.
- Use Level 3 to collect contextual usage information.
- Use Level 4 for identity-sensitive ecommerce data.
- Use Level 5 for confidential or commercial datasets.

Carefully evaluate your dataset’s sensitivity, business impact, and compliance obligations before selecting an access level.
