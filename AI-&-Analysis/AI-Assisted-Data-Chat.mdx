VoxDash now features seamless integration with ChatGPT, bringing AI-powered insights directly into your analytics workflow. This functionality allows users to interact with their data conversationally — no advanced analytics skills required.

## **What You Can Do With AI Chat**

With **AI Chat**, you can upload your data sets directly to VoxDash and begin asking natural-language questions. The AI interprets your queries and returns data-driven answers, helping you uncover trends, anomalies, and key takeaways quickly and intuitively.

## **Supported File Types**
VoxDash AI Chat supports a variety of file types, including:
### urvey files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx)
### SPSS datasets (.sav)
### Other structured data files
Upload one or more files from your project, and the AI will automatically process them for context-aware analysis.

## **Ask Questions Like a Human**
Forget about writing complex formulas or building pivot tables. Simply ask questions such as:
* “Which political party is likely to win based on this data, and why?”
* “What are the top concerns among respondents aged 18–25?”
* “Which products have the highest return rate and what could be the reason?”
* “Compare sales trends between Q1 and Q2.”
The AI interprets your intent and responds with clear, well-structured answers — often including charts, tables, or bullet points for clarity.

## **Use Case Examples**
Here are a few real-world scenarios where VoxDash AI Chat shines:
* **Market Research**: Understand public sentiment or predict consumer behavior by uploading survey results.
* **Ecommerce Analytics**: Upload sales or customer behavior data to identify top-performing products or user segments.
* **Academic Research**: Simplify your analysis of complex datasets without needing advanced statistics software.
## **Tips for Best Results**
* Use clear, specific questions to help the AI return accurate insights.
* When uploading multiple files, ensure that column headers are clearly labeled.
* For SPSS files, variable labels and metadata are automatically read and used in the analysis.
