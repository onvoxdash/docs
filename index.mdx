## About VoxDash

VoxDash is a cloud platform for publishing, governing, and discovering polling data. Data providers share and visualize survey results without exposing raw files. With multilingual support and fine-grained access controls, providers can manage access at the level of each file, variable, or survey question.

Access can be granted to specific users, groups, or entire email domains, and scheduled to start and expire on exact dates for embargoes or limited-time collaborations. Users can link multiple institutional and personal emails to a single account, switching easily between affiliations, seamlessly accessing datasets across all organizations to which they are affiliated.

VoxDash is the open-science home for polling data. It provides survey datasets and question-level results with a permanent, searchable, and open-access home, making polling evidence accessible, verifiable, and reusable. Every public dataset is free to deposit, free to use, and free forever, reflecting our commitment to the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

Every dataset and individual survey question receives a permanent webpage and persistent VoxDash ID for reliable citation, accompanied by structured metadata (including JSON-LD) to enhance discoverability. VoxDash solves a long-standing issue: most survey data lives in SPSS or CSV files, which are unindexed, unsearchable, and invisible to the broader world. The webpage generated for each survey question makes the survey results discoverable by search engines and AI.

### For Data Users

VoxDash automatically renders interactive dashboards for survey datasets – no downloads needed – so teams can filter, crosstab, and map results in the browser. Users can apply response option filters, code-out or group response options, and run crosstabs to gain deeper insights. Users can request access to datasets and manage organization invitations.

Public data appears in a searchable archive with filters, geographic visualizations, topic tags, and download options in standard formats (when permitted by the provider). Geographic data is automatically visualized with interactive maps, including automatic drilldowns (e.g., from country to state or province), and supports both ISO 3166 standards and provider-specific geo-codes. Data providers can upload their own coding schemes once, and VoxDash recognizes them across projects. When regional samples are small, providers can aggregate adjacent regions to stabilize maps and comparisons.

### For Data Owners/Providers: Governance & Monetization

For data owners, VoxDash provides a comprehensive control panel to publish selected data, set licenses, fine-tune visibility, and monetize access, down to the individual question level. It is a platform for showcasing your work, reaching new audiences, and generating revenue from previously untapped channels, while maintaining complete ownership and control over your data. Providers can attach customized terms and contracts to datasets and reuse them across projects, ensuring consistent governance and compliance without the need for repetitive setup. Private or embargoed datasets remain under the provider’s control, and providers can monetize access under their own terms.

VoxDash supports rich contextualization. Data providers can upload field documents and codebooks, as well as specify project-level metadata, including fieldwork dates, modes, and geographic coverage. They can also select from flexible licensing options (e.g., CC BY, CC0, or user-customized licenses). Data providers can access detailed audit logs that track the usage and downloads of their datasets. Each public data provider has a profile page that lists their uploaded projects and allows users to filter results by organization.

### For Data Owners/Providers: AI, Branding, and Security

VoxDash integrates AI assistance for data preparation and interpretation, including multilingual survey translation, automated metadata enrichment, and SPSS shell generation for streamlined analysis. Ask natural-language questions about your data – ‘How do Gen Z and Boomers differ on Q3?’ – and get instant answers without writing queries. For open-ended responses, VoxDash can propose and refine a codebook with you, then auto-code at scale (with options for sentiment, translation, and brand tagging).

Organizations can also run VoxDash on their own domain and brand the experience, from logo placement to full white-label configurations. Behind the scenes, VoxDash operates on hardened, auto-scaling cloud infrastructure with global acceleration and layered security (SSO/2FA, WAF, DDoS mitigation) to ensure data remains both fast and secure.

VoxDash creates a searchable, decentralized polling archive that connects data creators and data users, unlocking thousands of previously siloed surveys and fostering a diverse marketplace of voices. VoxDash enhances public discourse by expanding access to credible opinion data and giving voice to underrepresented polling sources.
