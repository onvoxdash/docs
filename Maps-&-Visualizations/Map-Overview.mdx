Maps in **VoxDash** help visualize geographic patterns, regional trends, and data distributions within your analytics system. Adding a map allows you to associate datasets, survey questions, or metrics with specific regions so users can **filter, compare, and analyze results geographically**.

Each map in VoxDash is based on **GeoJSON**, a standard file format used to describe geographic features such as countries, provinces, districts, or survey areas.

This guide will walk you through the steps to **create a new map**, **link it to geographic regions**, and **ensure it displays correctly** in the platform.

## **Understanding Maps in VoxDash**

If your survey includes a map variable (a question that refers to a geographic region), you can use the **Map Wizard**  to attach a map to your data project. Learn more about [SPSS Data Entry](/spss-data-entry).

By visiting the **[Maps page](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/maps)** in dataprovider, you can see all the maps added on VoxDash by admins or your self.

Alternatively, users can visit the **[Regions page](https://www.voxdash.com/geos)** in VoxDash to review existing geographic regions, click on each map to view the details of the map such as sub-regions and excisting data related to the map in VoxDash, and **download the regions Excel file**. This file contains region codes and names that can be used when setting up your SPSS data before uploading it to VoxDash.

    alt="regions"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

You can use either the region names or the ISO codes (both included in the downloaded file). VoxDash will recognize these and generate a map for your dataset.

VoxDash already includes most common geographic maps. However, there are cases where you may need to **add a new map manually**, such as:

1. The map region **doesn't exist** in VoxDash..
2. The map region  **exists** in VoxDash but it **doesn't contain** your desired sub-regions(e.g., districts or provinces).

## Search for a Country Map

Use the search bar to find maps by country name, then download the map and use it in SPSS for analysis.

## Steps to add a new map

### **1. Navigate to the Maps Page**

Go to the Maps page by clicking on the following link: [Maps Page](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/maps).

### **2. Add a New Map**

On the Maps page, locate and click the blue **Add Map** button in the top-right corner.

  <img
    src="/images/map-list.png"
    alt="add-map"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

### **3. Provide a Name for the Map**

Enter a descriptive name for your map that reflects its purpose, content, or the region it represents. This helps users identify the map easily.
Example:

✅ “Kenya – Counties” (good)

❌ “Map 1” (unclear)

**Note** Descriptive names make it easier for users to identify and select the correct map later.

  />
</Frame>

### **4. Choose the Relevant Region**

Select the appropriate region for your map from the dropdown list or search bar. This step ensures that the map is properly categorized and displayed with the correct geographical context.

    alt="add parent"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

### **5. Add the GeoJSON Code**

A GeoJSON file is a format for encoding geographical data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It is commonly used for representing geographic features, such as points, lines, and polygons, along with their associated attributes.

You can type the GeoJSON code for the geographic data you wish to include on the map. Make sure the code is formatted correctly to ensure proper display or use this [website](https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/) to paste the GeoJSON code.

  />
</Frame>

### **6. Handle Unrecognized Geographies**

If the geography you want to use does not appear in the region list, click the **Add New Region** option to define a new region.

**Define the New Region**

Provide a clear and accurate name for the new region. The name should properly reflect the geographical area it represents to avoid confusion.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/map-new-region.png"
    alt="add parent"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

**Select the Parent Region**

Each region in VoxDash exists within a geographical hierarchy, a structure that defines how locations relate to one another. Assigning a parent region ensures that your map fits correctly within this hierarchy, helping users filter and analyze data at different geographic levels.

**Understanding Region Hierarchy in VoxDash**

In VoxDash, geographic regions are typically arranged from larger to smaller administrative levels, for example:

* Continent (e.g, Africa)

* Country (e.g., Kenya)

* Province or State (e.g., Nairobi County)

* District or Sub-region (e.g., Westlands District)

**Note:** If your geographic data has more sub-region, you can add the map in VoxDash.

This hierarchy allows VoxDash to automatically:

* Aggregate data upward (e.g., from district to province).

* Filter reports and dashboards by geographic level.

Enable drill-down visualizations, where users can click from a country → province → district → local area.

**Add Additional Parent Regions (if applicable)**

If the new region falls under multiple parent regions, add each relevant parent region. This ensures that the region is correctly placed within the broader geographical structure.

**Add a Wikipedia Link (Optional)**

If a Wikipedia page exists for the region, you can include a link to provide users with additional context and information about the region.

    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

### **7. Click the Create Button**

Once all required fields are filled out, click the **Create** button in the bottom-right corner of the page to save your map and the associated region.

## **Editing Existing Maps**

Once a map is created, you can view, edit, or delete it directly from the Maps page.

To manage a map:

* 1.Go to the Maps page.

* 2.Click the **More (⋮)** menu next to the map you want to modify.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/edit-map.png"
    alt="edit-map"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

* 3.Choose one of the available options:

  **Edit Map:** Update the map’s name, parent region, or GeoJSON data.

  **View Regions:** Open the list of all regions associated with this map. Here you can add or edit alternative names to the regions.

<Frame>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/edit-alt-region.png"
    alt="edit-map"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

  **Delete Map:** Permanently remove the map from VoxDash.



## **Tips for Success**
* **Check GeoJSON Formatting:** Validate your GeoJSON file before uploading to avoid syntax or boundary errors.

* **Use Consistent Names:** Stick to a standard naming format for maps and regions (e.g., Country → State → City).

* **Verify Parent Relationships:** Ensure each region is correctly nested under its parent for accurate mapping.

* **Add External Links:** Linking to Wikipedia or official data sources improves credibility and context.

## **Integrating Maps with SPSS**

After creating or downloading your map:

1\. Open SPSS and import your dataset.

2\. In the Data Mapping Wizard (Step 3), select your Map Variable.

3\. Choose the corresponding VoxDash Map from the dropdown.

4\. Match region names or ISO codes with VoxDash’s entries.
 * If your dataset uses abbreviations, manually align them.

5\. For responses like “Don’t Know” or “Not Applicable”, select Don’t Map in VoxDash.

By following this step-by-step guide, you'll ensure that your maps and regions are added correctly, accurately categorized, and well-structured for easy use. This will help improve both the data organization and user experience.
