VoxDash provides interactive map visualizations to help you analyze survey responses geographically. These maps display insights based on respondents’ regions, allowing you to uncover regional trends, compare geographic distributions, and explore how responses vary across different areas.

You can also collapse the map or graph section at any time for a cleaner workspace.

## Select Map: 

The Select Map dropdown lists all the maps available for the current survey project. Each map type represents a different way of visualizing your data. Choose the one that best fits your analysis needs.

**Note:** Users can use the burger menu on the top right corner of each map to download different version of the map and use it in their analysis.

## **Types of Maps in VoxDash**

### Base map: 

The Base Map shows the percentage of responses by state or region. This provides a quick overview of where most responses are coming from.

You can configure the base map to display:

* **All Responses:** Shows the overall response rate for each region.

* **Specific Responses:** Filters the view to display results for a selected question or answer option.

    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

### Majority map:

The Majority Map highlights each state or region based on the most frequently selected response.
Each response option is color-coded, making it easy to identify dominant preferences and regional differences at a glance.

For example:

States where most respondents selected “Sales and service occupation” will appear in green color.

States where “Management occupation”” was the dominant answer will appear in blue.

This view helps users instantly identify which opinions or responses prevail in different geographic areas.

### Filtering Maps by Responses

The Responses Select Box allows you to refine what data is displayed on the map. This is especially useful when a question includes multiple answer options and you want to focus on one or more specific responses.

## **Customization**

Customized maps allow you to create aggregated regions, combining multiple states or territories into new, meaningful geographic groupings. This is especially useful for organizations or studies that analyze data across custom territories, sales regions, or combined areas (e.g., “East Coast” or “Western Provinces”).

In customization you can:

1\. Create new aggregated map based on your need 

2\. View peviousely aggregated maps that is provided by VoxDash’s admins.

**Note** You must be logged into your account to access customization features.

### **Creating a New Customized Map**

You can create a custom map by grouping multiple regions from the base map into new aggregated regions. This is useful when you want to analyze combined areas or custom territories.

Follow these steps to create a custom map:

1. **Select Region(s)**: Choose one or more regions from the base map.

2. **Choose Aggregate Name**: Assign a descriptive name for the new region (e.g., “Northeast Cluster”).

3. **Add to Aggregate List**: Add the selected region(s) to your aggregate list. Repeat this step for each group you wish to create.

4. **Choose Map Name**: Provide a name for your new customized map (e.g., “Regional Sales Map”).

**Tip:** Aggregation refers to combining numerical or categorical data from smaller regions (like states) into a larger, custom-defined region for easier comparison or analysis.

### View All Customized Maps

Click on **View All Customized Maps** to see all the custom maps created by you or the data provider.  
 Each supported map type (from the Select Map dropdown) may have its own set of customized maps.

* Customized maps will be listed under the base maps section.

* Only customized maps related to the currently selected base map will be displayed.

You can select any customized map to view its details and visual representation.


## **Editing Customized Maps**

When you click the **Edit** button on a customized map:

* You can rename the map.

* Add more states to an existing aggregated region.

* Create additional aggregated regions.

**Note :** A single state cannot belong to more than one aggregated group.

* You can’t add similar state in two aggregate group

## Select and View Specific Geography 

When a data project includes nested maps (e.g., Country → State), VoxDash automatically displays the highest-level (most expansive) map first.
Even if a user has not uploaded a national-level map, VoxDash will promote the largest available map as the top-level view.
Users can then explore subregions by **clicking directly** on a region within the map. If detailed data is available, VoxDash will automatically drill down into the more granular map.

## Conclusion

Map visualization in VoxDash transforms raw survey responses into actionable geographic insights. By combining interactive maps, filtering options, and customizable regions, you can:

* Discover how responses vary across locations,

* Identify dominant trends within regions, and

* Build custom groupings that match your organization’s structure or research focus.
