When a new organization is created within the platform, its name will automatically appear in the top navigation header. This allows users to quickly switch between organizations and access the corresponding data.

## **How to Select an Organization**

1. **Locate the Header Menu:** At the top of the website, you will see a dropdown or clickable menu labeled with the current organization name.
2. **Click to Expand the Menu:** Click the organization name to open the list of organizations available to your account.
3. **Choose an Organization:** Select the desired organization from the list. Once selected, VoxDash will load data and dashboards specific to that organization.

## **Understanding Organization Access**

* **User Access:** Each user can be a member of one or more organizations. Access to an organization depends on your user permissions, which are typically granted by an admin.
* **Roles and Permissions:** A user may have different roles in different organizations *(e.g., Admin in Organization A, Analyst in Organization B).* These roles define what actions you can perform, such as viewing reports, managing data sources, or editing configurations.
## **Adding a New Organization**

Users with the appropriate permissions can add a new organization to the system. This is useful when:
* Your team manages analytics for multiple businesses or clients.
* You want to separate environments or departments into distinct data spaces.
