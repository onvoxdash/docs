title: "What is an organization? (Data Provider)" 
---

In **VoxDash**, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a private **organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located.
When a new user registers on the VoxDash platform, the system immediately creates a dedicated organization for that user. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.
All data uploaded by the user, such as analytics reports, ecommerce datasets, or other structured information, will be stored within this organization. This ensures that your data is securely isolated from other users unless explicitly shared.

## **Key Features of an Organization in Data Provider Panel**

Each organization in VoxDash has its own data, users and SaaS plan, and the owner can create different organization to  manage everything better. Later the owner can switch between the organization through the header.

### Organization Settings

In VoxDash, users can [connect a vendor to an organization](https://help.voxdash.com/Organization-Setup/Add-Vendor-to-Organization). This allows for better collaboration, data management, and role assignment across surveys and analytics workflows.

### Setup Profile

When users sign up for VoxDash, a [personal profile page](https://help.voxdash.com/Vendors-&-Individuals/User-Profile-Page) is automatically created. This profile serves as a central place to manage personal details, showcase professional background, and contribute to the platform’s collaborative data environment.

## **How to Select an Organization**

## **Understanding Organization Access**

* **User Access:** Each user can be a member of one or more organizations. Access to an organization depends on your user permissions, which are typically granted by an admin.
* **Roles and Permissions:** A user may have different roles in different organizations *(e.g., Admin in Organization A, Analyst in Organization B).* These roles define what actions you can perform, such as viewing reports, managing data sources, or editing configurations.
## **Adding a New Organization**

Users with the appropriate permissions can add a new organization to the system. This is useful when:
* Your team manages analytics for multiple businesses or clients.
* You want to separate environments or departments into distinct data spaces.
