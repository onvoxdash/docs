title: "What is an organization?" 
---

In **VoxDash**, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a private **organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located.
When a new user registers on the VoxDash platform, the system immediately creates a dedicated organization for that user. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.
All data uploaded by the user—such as analytics reports, ecommerce datasets, or other structured information—will be stored within this organization. This ensures that your data is securely isolated from other users unless explicitly shared.

## **Key Features of an Organization**

Each organization in VoxDash comes with a comprehensive **Data Provider Panel** and a **Settings Dashboard** that allow you to manage your data and team efficiently.

* Track upload history and status

This panel serves as your main interface for managing any analytics or ecommerce-related data you bring into VoxDash.
