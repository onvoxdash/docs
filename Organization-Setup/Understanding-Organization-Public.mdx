In **VoxDash**, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a private **organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located.
When a new user registers on the VoxDash platform, the system immediately creates a dedicated organization for that user. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.
All data uploaded by the user, such as analytics reports, ecommerce datasets, or other structured information, will be stored within this organization. This ensures that your data is securely isolated from other users unless explicitly shared.
Every new organization that joined VoxDash for the first time, can view and use Data in [VoxDash Pubilc Archive](/Data-Projects/Voxdash-Public-Archive-Overview). 

**Important Notes:** 

* Each organization in VoxDash has its own data, owners can **switch** between the organization through the header.
* Each organization can invite other organizations to join them via their data provider panel
