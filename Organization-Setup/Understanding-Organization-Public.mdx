title: "What is an Organization - Public User ?"
---

In VoxDash, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a **private organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.

**Important Notes:** 

* Any user has access to view and use data in the [VoxDash Public Archive](/Data-Projects/Voxdash-Public-Archive-Overview). 
* Each organization in VoxDash has its own data, owners can **switch** between the organization through the header.
* Each organization can invite other organizations to join them via the data provider panel.
