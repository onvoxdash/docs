title: "What Is an Organization – Data Panel User?"
---

In **VoxDash**, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a private **organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located.
When a new user registers on the VoxDash platform, the system immediately creates a dedicated organization for that user. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.
All data uploaded by the user, such as analytics reports, e-commerce datasets, or other structured information, will be stored within this organization. This ensures that your data is securely isolated from other users unless explicitly shared.

**Important Note:** Each organization has its own data, users, and SaaS plan; the owner can create different organizations to manage everything better. Later, the owner can **switch** between organizations via the header.

## **Key Features of an Organization in the Data Provider Panel**

### Data Management

Within the **Data Provider Panel**, you can:

* View all uploaded [Data Projects](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/projects)

* Edit or update existing data entries

* Delete data that is no longer needed

* Track upload history and status

* Add related [vendor](/Vendors-&-Individuals/Add-A-New-Vendor) or [individual](/Vendors-&-Individuals/Add-A-New-Individual)

* Create [trends](Data-Projects/Trend-Analysis) from the uploaded data

* Create and manage [geographical Maps](Maps-&-Visualizations/Map-Overview)

**Note:** This panel serves as your main interface for managing any analytics or ecommerce-related data you bring into VoxDash.

* **Assign admins:** Grant administrative privileges to trusted members who can help manage the organization.

**Tips:** 

* The [Admin Management](https://help.voxdash.com/User-Management/Admin-Management) page allows organizations to assign employees to different administrative roles within their VoxDash account.

* **User Access:** Each user can be a member of one or more organizations. Access to an organization depends on your user permissions, which are typically granted by an admin.

* **Roles and Permissions:** A user may have different roles in different organizations *(e.g., Admin in Organization A, Analyst in Organization B).* These roles define what actions you can perform, such as viewing reports, managing data sources, or editing configurations.

### Homepage Customization

You can personalize the landing experience for users in your organization by editing the [homepage setup](https://help.voxdash.com/Organization-Setup/Organization-Home-Page-Setup). This includes configuring widgets, charts, or reports that appear by default when users log in.

### Security Settings

[Security](https://help.voxdash.com/Access-Controls/Security-&-Permissions) is a core part of organizational management. You can:

* Set password policies
* Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
* Control session timeouts
* Manage access levels and data sharing permissions

### Organization Settings

In VoxDash, users can [connect a vendor to an organization](https://help.voxdash.com/Organization-Setup/Add-Vendor-to-Organization). This allows for better collaboration, data management, and role assignment across surveys and analytics workflows.

### Setup Profile

When users sign up for VoxDash, a [personal profile page](https://help.voxdash.com/Vendors-&-Individuals/User-Profile-Page) is automatically created. This profile serves as a central place to manage personal details, showcase professional background, and contribute to the platform’s collaborative data environment.
