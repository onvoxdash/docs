## **How to Add Maps**

Follow the steps below to add a map to the system.

### **1\. Navigate to the Maps Page**

Go to the Maps page by clicking on the following link: [Maps Page](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/maps).

### **2\. Add a New Map**

On the Maps page, locate and click the blue **"Add Map"** button in the top-right corner.

### **3\. Provide a Name for the Map**

Enter a descriptive name for your map that reflects its purpose, content, or the region it represents. This helps users identify the map easily.


### **4\. Choose the Relevant Region**

Select the appropriate region for your map from the dropdown list or search bar. This step ensures that the map is properly categorized and displayed with the correct geographical context.


### **5\. Add the GeoJSON Code**

A GeoJSON file is a format for encoding geographical data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It is commonly used for representing geographic features, such as points, lines, and polygons, along with their associated attributes.

You can use this website to paste or type the GeoJSON code for the geographic data you wish to include on the map. Make sure the code is formatted correctly to ensure proper display.

### **6\. Handle Unrecognized Geographies**

If the geography you want to use does not appear in the region list, click the **"Add New Region"** option to define a new region.

### **7\. Define the New Region**

Provide a clear and accurate name for the new region. The name should properly reflect the geographical area it represents to avoid confusion.

### **8\. Select the Parent Region**

Assign a parent region to the new region. The parent region should make logical sense within the geographical hierarchy to maintain a well-structured system.


### **9\. Add Additional Parent Regions (if applicable)**

If the new region falls under multiple parent regions, add each relevant parent region. This ensures that the region is correctly placed within the broader geographical structure.


### **10\. Add a Wikipedia Link (Optional)**

If a Wikipedia page exists for the region, you can include a link to provide users with additional context and information about the region.

Once all required fields are filled out, click the **Create** button in the bottom-right corner of the page to save your map and the associated region.

**Tips for Success:**

* **Ensure GeoJSON Code Accuracy**: Double-check that the GeoJSON code is properly formatted and represents the correct geographic area. Errors in code can result in maps not displaying correctly.  
* **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming practices for maps and regions to maintain organization and clarity throughout the system.  
* **Verify Parent Regions**: Carefully confirm that the parent regions you assign are appropriate for the new region to avoid logical inconsistencies in the geographical hierarchy.  
* **Include Relevant Links**: If a Wikipedia page or other relevant resources exist for the region, include the link to provide users with additional context and detailed information.

By following this step-by-step guide, you'll ensure that your maps and regions are added correctly, accurately categorized, and well-structured for easy use. This will help improve both the data organization and user experience.
