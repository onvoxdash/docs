Who this is for

Use this guide if you primarily consume data and insights — browsing dashboards, searching datasets, exploring survey questions, and viewing maps — without importing or modeling data yourself.

Quick checklist

- Get access: confirm your account and permissions with your admin. See: [User Management](/wiki/user-management), [User Groups](/wiki/user-groups), [Security Settings](/wiki/security-settings)
- Start at the overview: review storage, usage, and activity on the [Dashboard](/wiki/dashboard)
- Find data fast: use [Advanced Search](/wiki/advanced-search) to locate projects, questions, vendors, and individuals
- Explore projects: open a project from the [Projects List](/wiki/data-project-list) and review details on the [Project Page](/wiki/data-project-page)
- Understand structure: inspect fields and metadata on the [Data Profile](/wiki/data-profile)
- Analyze survey questions: browse the [Question List](/wiki/question-list) and drill into a [Question Page](/wiki/question-page)
- Visualize on maps: view [Maps](/wiki/map) and geographic detail with [Drilldown Map](/wiki/drilldown-map); see also [Map Visualization (Questions)](/wiki/map-visualization-question-page)

1. Access and sign‑in

- If your organization restricts content, ensure your user is added and assigned to the right group: [User Management](/wiki/user-management), [User Groups](/wiki/user-groups)
- For SSO, MFA, and related controls, see: [Security Settings](/wiki/security-settings)
- If some content is intended for public viewers, your admin may enable it: [Public Access](/wiki/public-access)

2. Discover relevant data

- Start with the [Dashboard](/wiki/dashboard) for recent activity, usage, and quick links
- Use [Advanced Search](/wiki/advanced-search) to filter by entity, tag, field, date, or text
- Browse the [Projects List](/wiki/data-project-list) and pick a project to open its [Project Page](/wiki/data-project-page)

3. Explore surveys and questions

- Open the [Question List](/wiki/question-list) in a project to see available survey questions
- Drill into a [Question Page](/wiki/question-page) for distributions, filters, and metadata
- Compare geographic patterns via [Maps](/wiki/map) and [Drilldown Map](/wiki/drilldown-map)
- For question‑level mapping, see: [Map Visualization (Questions)](/wiki/map-visualization-question-page)

4. Understand fields and governance

- Use the [Data Profile](/wiki/data-profile) to learn fields, types, constraints, and lineage
- If content is restricted, request access from your admin based on [Entity Access](/wiki/entity-access)

5. Tips

- Trends: check the [Trends](/wiki/trend) view for high‑level indicators
- Vendors and individuals: browse [Vendors](/wiki/vendor-list), [Vendor Page](/wiki/vendor-page), and [Individuals](/wiki/individual-list) when relevant to your analysis
