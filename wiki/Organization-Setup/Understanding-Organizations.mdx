title: "What is an organization?" 
---

In **VoxDash**, every user who signs up is automatically assigned to a private **organization**. This organization acts as the central workspace where all your data, settings, and team management tools are located.
When a new user registers on the VoxDash platform, the system immediately creates a dedicated organization for that user. This organization is private by default, meaning only the creator initially has access to it.
All data uploaded by the user—such as analytics reports, ecommerce datasets, or other structured information—will be stored within this organization. This ensures that your data is securely isolated from other users unless explicitly shared.

## **Key Features of an Organization**

Each organization in VoxDash comes with a comprehensive **Data Provider Panel** and a **Settings Dashboard** that allow you to manage your data and team efficiently.

### **1\. Data Management** \[[Wiki link1](?tab=t.te1rw7f1h2yf)\- [Wiki link 2](?tab=t.tctuso95u8ay#heading=h.1a3v5fpla6x1)\]

Within the **Data Provider Panel**, you can:

* View all uploaded datasets
* Edit or update existing data entries
* Delete data that is no longer needed
* Track upload history and status

This panel serves as your main interface for managing any analytics or ecommerce-related data you bring into VoxDash.

### **2\. User & Team Management** [Data Panel Dashboard](/wiki/Reports-&-Dashboards/Data-Panel-Dashboard) and [Data Entry](/wiki/SPSS-&-Data-Entry/Data-Entry-Overview)

In the **Organization Settings Tab**, you can perform several administrative tasks, including:

* **Set up your organization profile:** Define the organization name, logo, and description.
* **Manage users:** Invite new users by email, assign roles, or remove users.
* **Create user groups:** Organize users into logical teams or departments for easier permission control.
* **Assign admins:** Grant administrative privileges to trusted members who can help manage the organization.
* **Add vendors:** Integrate third-party vendors or external collaborators into the organization.

### **3\. Homepage Customization** \[[Wiki link](?tab=t.f8m8q0k6qf83)\]

You can personalize the landing experience for users in your organization by editing the **homepage setup**. This includes configuring widgets, charts, or reports that appear by default when users log in.

### **4\. Security Settings** \[[Wiki link](?tab=t.e5xwlaaunfln)\]

Security is a core part of organizational management. You can:

* Set password policies
* Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
* Control session timeouts
* Manage access levels and data sharing permissions

**5\. Admins Management** \[[Wiki link](?tab=t.ubclt9gw3bem)\]

The **Admin Management** page allows organizations to assign employees to different administrative roles within their VoxDash account.

**6.Organization Setting** \[[Wiki link](?tab=t.tr8rugft2cd8)\]

In VoxDash, users can connect a vendor to an organization. This allows for better collaboration, data management, and role assignment across surveys and analytics workflows.

**7.Setup Profile** \[[Wiki link](?tab=t.s7u1syz55zf)\]

When users sign up for VoxDash, a **personal profile page** is automatically created. This profile serves as a central place to manage personal details, showcase professional background, and contribute to the platform’s collaborative data environment.
