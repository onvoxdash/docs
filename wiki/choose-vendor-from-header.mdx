# Choose Vendor from Header

When a new organization is created within the platform, its name will automatically appear in the top navigation header. This allows users to quickly switch between organizations and access the corresponding data.

### **How to Select an Organization**

1. **Locate the Header Menu:** At the top of the website, you will see a dropdown or clickable menu labeled with the current organization name.
2. **Click to Expand the Menu:** Click the organization name to open the list of organizations available to your account.
3. **Choose an Organization:** Select the desired organization from the list. Once selected, VoxDash will load data and dashboards specific to that organization.

### **Understanding Organization Access**

- **User Access:** Each user can be a member of one or more organizations. Access to an organization depends on your user permissions, which are typically granted by an admin.
- **Roles and Permissions:** A user may have different roles in different organizations _(e.g., Admin in Organization A, Analyst in Organization B)._ These roles define what actions you can perform, such as viewing reports, managing data sources, or editing configurations.

### **Adding a New Organization**

Users with the appropriate permissions can add a new organization to the system. This is useful when:

- Your team manages analytics for multiple businesses or clients.
- You want to separate environments or departments into distinct data spaces.
