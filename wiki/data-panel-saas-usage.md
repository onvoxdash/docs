**Data panel Saas usage**

VoxDash offers various subscription plans under the SaaS (Software as a Service) model. This means you get access to advanced data analytics and ecommerce features based on your selected plan, with flexibility to scale according to your needs.

Each subscription plan in VoxDash is referred to as a **SaaS plan**. These plans are designed to support businesses of different sizes and goals, offering both standard and advanced features to enhance your data-driven decision-making.

### **Subscription Management**

You can **upgrade**, **downgrade**, or **cancel** your plan at any time through your account dashboard:

* **Upgrade** to access more features or increase usage limits.

* **Downgrade** to reduce your plan level and costs.

* **Cancel** the plan if you no longer need the service.

By default, **SaaS plans are recurring**, meaning your payment method will be automatically charged at the beginning of each billing cycle (typically monthly).

**Types of Features in SaaS Plans**

VoxDash plans include two categories of features:

### **1\. Standard Features**

* These features **reset monthly** once your subscription is renewed.

* You are allowed a **fixed monthly quota** for each standard feature.

* Once the quota resets, you can fully use those features again for the rest of the month.

### **2\. Disposable Features**

* These features come with a **one-time quota** included in your plan.

* The usage limit does **not reset monthly**.

* You can use the remaining balance each month until it's fully consumed.

* Once the quota is exhausted, you have two options:

  * **Upgrade your plan** to a higher tier with more disposable feature capacity.

  * **Purchase an add-on** to increase your quota for that feature.

## **Add-Ons**

Add-ons are additional feature packages that you can purchase separately to enhance your plan. VoxDash offers two types of add-ons:

### **1\. Recurring Add-Ons**

* These are **billed monthly** along with your main plan.

* Once activated, the associated features are added to your account each month.

### **2\. One-Time Add-Ons**

* These are **single-purchase** features.

* You pay once and get access for **lifetime use**, with no recurring fees.

This flexibility allows you to customize your experience and scale usage without switching plans entirely.

## **Checking and Managing Your Plan**

You can manage your SaaS plan directly through the **Data Panel** in your VoxDash account:

* If you already have a subscription, navigate to your **Plan Overview** and click on the **Manage** button.

  * From there, you can:

    * View your current feature usage

    * Monitor disposable feature balances

    * Upgrade or downgrade your plan

    * Add or remove add-ons

* If you're a new user, click on the **Get Started** button to select and purchase your first SaaS plan.

We recommend reviewing your usage regularly to ensure your current plan aligns with your business needs. This helps you avoid feature overages or underutilization.
