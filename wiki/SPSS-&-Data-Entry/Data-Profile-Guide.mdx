## **What is a Data Profile in Statistics?**

Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing, and creating useful summaries of data. This process provides a high-level overview that aids in identifying data quality issues, risks, and overall trends. Data profiling generates critical insights that companies can leverage to improve decision-making and optimize operations.
