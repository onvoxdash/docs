**Drilldown map wiki with examples**

Some data projects in VoxDash include multiple geographic maps that are hierarchically related—for example, a national map and corresponding state or provincial maps.

To help users explore this structure intuitively, VoxDash offers a drilldown map feature, allowing seamless navigation between high-level and detailed geographic views.

## How It Works

* When a dataset includes nested maps (e.g., Country → State), VoxDash automatically displays the highest-level (most expansive) map first.

* Even if a user has not uploaded a national-level map, VoxDash will promote the largest available map as the top-level view.

* Users can then explore subregions by clicking directly on a region within the map. If detailed data is available, VoxDash will automatically drill down into the more granular map.

---

## **Example:**

If a dataset includes both:

* A **United States map**, and

* **State-level maps** for California, Texas, and New York,

Then:

1. VoxDash will display the **U.S. map** as the entry point.

2. When a user clicks on **California**, they’ll be taken to a **state-level map of California**, where more detailed data may be shown.

3. If the user returns to the U.S. map, they can explore another region (e.g., Texas).

## **Alternate Navigation:**

Users can also access detailed maps **manually** using the **Drilldown Menu**, which appears above the map as a **dropdown or selection bar**

This allows users to:

* Switch between geographic levels (e.g., from *Region* to *City*),

* Compare data across areas,

* Or focus on a specific subregion without needing to click through the larger map.
