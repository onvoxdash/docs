After completing the upload process, the files will appear in your **Data Projects List**. You can now locate and manage your newly added datasets from this list.  

### **Additional Notes**

* **Data Entry:** While the bulk upload handles the file upload process, any required data entry for the projects should be completed separately. Make sure to navigate to the relevant sections of the application to input any additional project metadata or configuration.  
* **Supported Formats:** Ensure that the files and folders you upload are in the supported formats specified by the platform. Unsupported formats may result in errors or skipped files during the upload process.

By using the **Bulk New Project Upload** feature, you can save time and streamline the process of managing multiple datasets in your projects. For further assistance, refer to the help section or contact customer support.
