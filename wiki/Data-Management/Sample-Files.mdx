## **What is a Sample File?**

 A sample file is a smaller, representative portion of your dataset that provides an overview of the structure, variables, and type of data collected. If you have a private or paid survey file, you can share a sample file to give users a preview of your data without disclosing the entire dataset. This allows users to understand the format of your SPSS file, the type of questions included in your surveys, and how the data is structured before accessing or purchasing the full dataset.
