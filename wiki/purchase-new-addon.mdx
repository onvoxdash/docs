**Purchase New Add-on For Pro plan Users**

The **Pro Plan** provides a comprehensive set of features tailored for growing teams that need advanced data analytics and e-commerce tools. However, every business is different, and your data needs may grow beyond the standard limits provided in the Pro Plan.

To help you scale **on-demand**, VoxDash offers **feature-specific add-ons**. These add-ons allow Pro Plan users to purchase additional capacity for specific features without upgrading to an Enterprise Plan.

### **Why Use Add-ons?**

Add-ons are ideal when:

* You’re running a high-volume survey campaign and need more storage or sample size.

* Your organization grows and requires more user access points or domains.

* You need additional AI credits for deep, prompt-based data analysis.

***Note**:* Add-ons allow you to stay on the Pro Plan while extending only the features you need.
