In the **Data Project** section, you can configure **Entity Access** settings to control who can view or modify your project. This feature allows you to assign roles, set data restrictions, and define expiration dates for access. The **Entity Access** column is located in the eighth column on the **Data Project** page.

## **Ownership Access Levels**

Ownership access lets you control who can interact with your data. It can be assigned to a user, user group, or domain user group, with an optional start and end date. Here are the levels explained in plain terms:

### **Owner Level**

**What they can do:** Full control over the data, including deleting, replacing, and deleting files.
**Special role:** The person who first uploads the data is called the "Data Provider." They are the only ones who can:
* Permanently delete (hard delete) the data.
* Add other owners.

### **Organizer Level**

* ### **What they can do:** Almost everything the owner can, including accessing data through the data-provider panel and voxdash.com.

**What they cannot do:**
* Delete, replace, or cut files.
* Assign another organizer for the data.

### **Download Level**
**What they can do:**
* Access specific data or survey questions.
* Download it from voxdash.com.

**What they cannot do:** No access to the data-provider panel.

### **Viewer Level**

**What they can do:**
View specific files or survey questions (if VoxDash allows it).

**What they cannot do:**
* Download the files.
* Access the data-provider panel.

**Where they access it:** **Public** website only.

## **Catalog Level**

**What they can do:** 
View basic information about the Data Project added to VoxDash by the data provider.

**What they cannot do:**
* Access the data itself.

**Where they access it:** **Public** website only.

## **Tips:**
* **Bulk Editing:** If you need to modify access for multiple entities at once, use the bulk editing feature in the top menu of the **Data Project** page.  
* **Audit Logs:** For security and compliance purposes, you can view a history of access changes in the **Audit Logs** section.  
* **Notifications:** The invited users will receive an email notification with a link to access the project, if applicable.
