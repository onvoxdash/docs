**Who this is for**

Use this guide if you primarily consume data and insights — browsing dashboards, searching datasets, exploring survey questions, and viewing maps — without importing or modeling data yourself.

**Quick checklist**

- Get access: confirm your account and permissions with your admin. See: [User Management](/User-Management/User-Management), [User Groups](/User-Management/Create-&-Manage-User-Groups), [Security Settings](/Access-Controls/Security-&-Permissions)
- Start at the overview: review storage, usage, and activity on the [Dashboard](/Reports-&-Dashboards/Data-Panel-Dashboard)
- Find data fast: use [Advanced Search](/Data-Projects/Advanced-Search) to locate projects, questions, vendors, and individuals
- Explore projects: open a project from the [Projects List](/Data-Projects/Data-Project-List) and review details on the [Project Overview](/Data-Projects/Data-Project-Overrview)
- Understand structure: inspect fields and metadata on the [Data Profile](/SPSS-&-Data-Entry/Data-Profile-Guide)
- Analyze survey questions: browse the [Question List](/Survey-Questions/Survey-Questions-List) and drill into a [Question Page](/Survey-Questions/Question-Page-Overview)
- Visualize on maps: view [Maps](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Map-Overview) and geographic detail with [Drilldown Map](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Drilldown-Map-Examples); see also [Map Visualization (Questions)](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Map-Visualization-Guide)

1. **Access and sign‑in**

- If your organization restricts content, ensure your user is added and assigned to the right group: [User Management](/User-Management/User-Management), [User Groups](/User-Management/Create-&-Manage-User-Groups)
- For SSO, MFA, and related controls, see: [Security Settings](/Access-Controls/Security-&-Permissions)
- If some content is intended for public viewers, your admin may enable it: [Public Access](/Access-Controls/Public-Access-Settings)

2. **Discover relevant data**

- Use [Advanced Search](/Data-Projects/Advanced-Search) to filter by entity, tag, field, date, or text
- Browse the [Projects List](/Data-Projects/Data-Project-List) and pick a project to open its [Project Page](/Data-Projects/Data-Project-Overrview)
- Viwe the [VoxDash Public Archive](/Data-Projects/Voxdash-Public-Archive-Overview),that acts as a central library for freehand public survey data.

3. **Explore surveys and questions**

- Open the [Question List](/Survey-Questions/Survey-Questions-List) in a project to see available survey questions
- Drill into a [Question Page](/Survey-Questions/Question-Page-Overview) for distributions, filters, and metadata
- Compare geographic patterns via [Maps](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Map-Overview) and [Drilldown Map](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Drilldown-Map-Examples)
- For question‑level mapping, see: [Map Visualization (Questions)](/Maps-&-Visualizations/Map-Visualization-Guide)

4. **Understand fields and governance**

- Use the [Data Profile](/SPSS-&-Data-Entry/Data-Profile-Guide) to learn fields, types, constraints, and lineage
- If content is restricted, request access from your admin based on [Entity Access](/Access-Controls/Entity-Level-Access-Control)

5. **Tips**

- Trends: check the [Trends](/Data-Projects/Trend-Analysis) view for high‑level indicators
- Vendors and individuals: browse [Vendors](/Vendors-&-Individuals/Vendors-Directory), [Vendor Page](/Vendors-&-Individuals/Vendor-Page-Overview), and [Individuals](/Vendors-&-Individuals/Individuals-Directory) when relevant to your analysis

**Need more access?**

If something is hidden or you hit a permissions issue, contact your admin. They can adjust: [User Management](/User-Management/User-Management), [User Groups](/User-Management/Create-&-Manage-User-Groups.mdx), [Entity Access](/Access-Controls/Entity-Level-Access-Control), [Security Settings](/Access-Controls/Security-&-Permissions).
