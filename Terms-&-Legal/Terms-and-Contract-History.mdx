title: "Terms & Conditions History"
---

Each data project must include a **Terms & Conditions** document.
This document defines the legal and usage rules that apply to the dataset.

The T&C may cover:
* Permitted and restricted usage
* Data redistribution policies
* Download limitations
* Confidentiality requirements
* Compliance obligations
* Expiration terms
* Liability disclaimers

Since legal requirements and business policies may change over time, each project can have multiple versions of its Terms & Conditions.

The **Terms & Conditions History** section allows you to review all previous and current versions of a project’s Terms & Conditions.

## Accessing Terms & Conditions History

To view the Terms & Conditions history:

1. Navigate to the **File Manager**
2. Locate the desired project
3. Click the **hamburger menu (⋮)** next to the project
4. Select **T&C History**

You will be redirected to the T&C History table for that specific project.

## What You Can See in the T&C History Table

The table displays all versions of the Terms & Conditions associated with the selected project.

For each version, you can view:

### Version Name

A unique identifier or title for that specific version of the Terms & Conditions.

Example:

* T&C v1.0 – Initial Release
* T&C v2.0 – Updated Download Policy

### Start Date

The date when the version became active.

This indicates when the terms started applying to new users or new access approvals.

### End Date

The date when the version was replaced or deactivated.

If no end date is shown, the version is currently active.


## Why Version History Matters

Tracking T&C versions helps you:
* Maintain legal transparency
* Support compliance audits
* Identify which users accepted which version
* Resolve disputes related to past access terms
* Monitor policy evolution over time

Each approved user is typically bound by the version active at the time of access approval.

## Features Available on the T&C History Page

The T&C History table includes management tools to help you navigate large version histories.

### Search

Use the search bar to quickly find:
* A specific version name
* Keywords within version titles

This is useful when multiple updates have been published over time.

### Filter

Apply filters to narrow results based on:

* Active vs. expired versions
* Date ranges
* Specific version naming conventions

Filtering allows you to focus on relevant policy periods.

### Column Ordering

You can customize the table view by:

* Reordering columns
* Sorting by start date, end date, or version name

For example:

* Sort by Start Date to view versions chronologically
* Sort by End Date to identify recently expired terms

## Viewing Full T&C Details

To view the full content of a specific version:

1. Click the **icon next to the version name**
2. You will be redirected to the detailed T&C page

On that page, you can:
* Read the full legal text
* Review policy changes
* Verify the exact terms that were active during a specific period

## Best Practices

* Update Terms & Conditions whenever usage policies change.
* Use clear version naming conventions (e.g., v1.0, v2.1).
* Review T&C updates before approving new access requests.
* Keep historical versions for compliance and audit purposes.

The T&C History section ensures full traceability of policy changes and supports secure, compliant data sharing within the platform.
