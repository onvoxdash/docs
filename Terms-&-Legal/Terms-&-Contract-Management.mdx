In this guide, you will learn how to add Terms and Conditions (T\&C) in three different ways using our SaaS application and how to manage them. The methods include:

1. Add from the Terms and Conditions section in the Data Project
2. Add from the Data Entry Wizard 10, Terms and Conditions for Data Projects
3. Add and manage from the Terms and Conditions Page

## 1\. Adding T\&C from the Terms and Conditions Section in the Data Project

You can either add new terms and conditions or select from the previousely added one.

1. **Complete the Form:**  
* **Add a Title:** Provide a descriptive title for the T\&C.  
* **Add a Version Name:** Specify a version to track changes.  
* **Add a URL:** Enter the URL linking to the T\&C (ensure it’s from the hosting site).  

* **Upload Documents (Optional):** Attach any relevant documents.  

2. **Save Changes:**  
* Once all fields are completed, click the blue button at the bottom-right corner to save the T\&C.
By following these steps, you can effectively add or update the Terms and Conditions for your project, ensuring compliance and accuracy.

## **2\. Adding T\&C from Data Entry Wizard 10**
The tenth wizard in the general data entry process allows you to add Terms and Conditions.

### **Steps to Follow**
The process is identical to the one described in the Terms and Conditions Section in the **Data Project**. Use Wizard 10 to access and add a T\&C like the previouse **Method 1**, or use the previousely added conditions.

By completing these steps, you can seamlessly integrate T\&C into your data entry workflow.

## **3\. Add and manage from the Terms and Conditions Page**
You can also directly add or manage Terms and Conditions through the dedicated **Terms and Conditions Page.**

### **Accessing the Page**

1. Go to the Terms and Conditions tab.  
2. Search for existing T\&C by name.  
3. Click on a file to view its details.

### **Adding or Editing T\&C**

1. **View or Edit Existing T\&C:**  
Click the **Edit** button to view different versions or modify the current version.  
2. **Add a New Version:**  
Follow the same steps outlined in the **first method** to create a new version.    
* You can view existing Terms and Conditions in different versions.  
* You can add a new version by following steps similar to those for creating a new T\&C file.

**Note** If you have uploaded a sensitive data and users **must** accept and follow your terms and conditions, there is a select box in all three methods, that users must first accept the terms and conditions then be able to either view or use your data.

By using the tools available on this page, you can efficiently manage multiple versions of Terms and Conditions, ensuring they stay up-to-date and meet your project’s requirements.
