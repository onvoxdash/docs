The **VoxDash Public Archive** is a dedicated organization within the VoxDash platform, created by our team to provide users with open access to publicly available survey datasets. These datasets have been collected from a wide range of public sources across the internet and compiled into a single, searchable repository for your convenience.

### **What Is the VoxDash Public Archive?**

The VoxDash Public Archive acts as a central library for freehand public survey data. Our team has carefully searched, curated, and uploaded a collection of open-access survey projects. This archive enables users to explore real-world data, gain insights, test the VoxDash platform features, and accelerate their data analytics workflows, without needing to create a project from scratch.

### **Accessing the Public Archive**

All VoxDash users can browse, view, and analyze data within the VoxDash Public Archive; no special permissions are required. Just log into your VoxDash account, navigate to the Data project tab, and select [VoxDash Public Archive](https://www.voxdash.com/PublicArchive) from the list of organizations.

Here you can:

* View all public projects and datasets.

* Open survey projects in the dashboard.

* Run analysis using built-in analytics tools.

* Create visualizations and reports based on the public data.

This is especially helpful for new users who want to familiarize themselves with VoxDash features before uploading their own data.

### **Contributing to the Archive**

When you upload a data project to VoxDash, you have the option to set its visibility as **Public** or **Private**. If you choose to make a project public, it will automatically be linked to the **VoxDash Public Archive** organization. This means other users will be able to access and explore your dataset, just like the existing public projects in the archive.

Please ensure that any data you upload as public does not contain personal, sensitive, or proprietary information. By contributing to the archive, you help enrich the VoxDash community with valuable datasets that others can learn from and build upon.
