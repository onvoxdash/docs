title: "Preparing Your SPSS File for VoxDash" 
---
Every data project in VoxDash requires an SPSS file to facilitate further analysis.

## **Key Components of a Good SPSS File**

A well-structured SPSS file should include:

1. **Comprehensive Question Labels** – Ensure that all survey questions are clearly labeled in the "Label" field within the SPSS application. This helps in understanding the context of the data during analysis.  
2. **Meaningful Response Values** – Each response option should have a corresponding descriptive value in the "Value" column. Meaningful value labels allow for easier interpretation and reporting of data.

## **Structuring Survey Data in SPSS**
Surveys typically consist of a series of questions with predefined answer options. Respondents select their responses based on their opinions. In SPSS, survey data is usually structured by assigning numerical codes to response options. This method allows for efficient data analysis and trend identification.

### **Best Practices for Data Structure**
For optimal analysis in VoxDash, it is recommended to:
* Store responses using numeric values with clear labels.  
* Avoid repeating the same question multiple times with different responses in a single column. For instance, instead of repeating a question four times for four different responses, it's better to maintain a single entry with multiple response options.
Uploading files with repeated questions can cause issues with trend analysis and comparisons, especially for recurring surveys. Therefore, it is advised to avoid such data structures when preparing your SPSS file for VoxDash.

## **Optimizing SPSS Data Entry for VoxDash**
When entering SPSS data into VoxDash, the second wizard allows you to create shortcuts or ignore specific variables. To expedite this process, consider making changes to your SPSS file before uploading.

### **Naming Conventions**
To facilitate automatic processing in VoxDash, follow these naming guidelines:
1. **Shortcuts:**  
   * Prefix variable names with `Shortcut_` to mark them for quick access.  
   * Example: `Shortcut_Age`, `Shortcut_Income`.  
2. **Ignored Variables:**  
   * Prefix variable names with `Hide_` to exclude them from analysis.  
   * Example: `Hide_TestVariable`, `Hide_InternalNotes`.
By following these conventions, VoxDash will automatically recognize and apply these changes, reducing the need for manual adjustments during the second wizard step.

## **Summary**
To ensure a smooth data analysis process in VoxDash:
* Prepare SPSS files with clear labels and meaningful response values.  
* Avoid repeated questions for better trend analysis.  
* Use appropriate naming conventions to streamline the data entry process.
Following these best practices will enhance the efficiency and accuracy of your analytics workflow in VoxDash.
