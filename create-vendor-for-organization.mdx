**Create vendor for organization**

In VoxDash, users can connect a vendor to an organization. This allows for better collaboration, data management, and role assignment across surveys and analytics workflows.

You can either:

* Create a new vendor specifically for your organization, or

* Link an existing vendor that has already been added to the platform.

Once connected, vendors will be visible to all relevant users in the Data Provider Panel.
