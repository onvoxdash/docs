When an organization has added multiple users, it can simplify project access management by creating **User Groups**. A User Group allows you to assign access permissions to several users at once, rather than configuring each user individually.

## How to Create a User Group

**Note:** Before adding a new user group choose the organization from header first, then follow these steps to add a new user group to your organization:

1. Navigate to the [User Group](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/org/userGroups) section in organization page.

2. Click on the **Add User Group** button.

3. Enter a **name** for the group. For example:

**Editors:** Users who can edit content or data

**Admins:** Users with full access and management permissions

**Viewers:** Users with read-only access

4. **Add users** to the group by selecting them from the user list.

## **Steps to Enable or Edit User Groups Access:**

Once created, you can assign the User Group to a project or set access levels for that group, making it easier to manage permissions across your organization. Follow these steps to give access to your user groups:

### **1\. Locate the Entity Access Column**

* Navigate to the [Data Project](https://dataprovider.voxdash.com/projects) page in your application.  
* Look for the **Entity Access** column, which is the eighth column from the left.

### **2\. Open the Editing Menu**

* Click on the arrow icon next to the relevant entry in the **Entity Access** column.  
* A menu will appear, allowing you to adjust access settings.

### **3\. Add New Access Permissions**

* In the editing menu, locate and click the **Add** blue button in the bottom-left corner of the menu.

### **4\. Configure Access Details**

* **Select User Groups:** Choose the groups you want to grant access to.  

* **Assign Roles:** Assign a role to the selected group (e.g., Viewer, Editor, Admin) based on their level of required access.   

 **Note:** If a user group have **organizer** or **owner** role, can access to **data provider panel** of the specific data, other ways, users have access only via **public website**.

* **Set Data Restrictions:** Optionally, limit user access to specific datasets or functions within the project.  

* **Define Expiration Date:** If necessary, set an expiration date for access permissions to ensure temporary access.
