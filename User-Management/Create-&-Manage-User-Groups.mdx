title: "Create & Manage User Groups"

When an organization has added multiple users, it can simplify project access management by creating **User Groups**. A User Group allows you to assign access permissions to several users at once, rather than configuring each user individually.

## How to Create a User Group

1. Navigate to the **User Management Section** of your dashboard.

2. Click on the **Add User Group** button.

</Frame>

3. Enter a **name** for the group. For example:

**Editors** – users who can edit content or data
**Admins** – users with full access and management permissions
**Viewers** – users with read-only access

4. **Add users** to the group by selecting them from the user list.

Once created, you can assign the User Group to a project or set access levels for that group, making it easier to manage permissions across your organization.

### Tip:
You can edit a group at any time to add or remove users, or to change its name and permissions.
