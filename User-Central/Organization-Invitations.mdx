title: "Organization Invitations"
---


The platform allows organizations to invite users to join their workspace as members or administrators.
Invitations ensure that users gain the appropriate access level within an organization in a secure and controlled way.

Invitations may be triggered in two scenarios:

**1.** An organization manually adds a user’s email address through **User Management** or **Admin Management**.

**2.** A user requests access to restricted data, and the organization approves the request in a way that requires organizational membership.

In both cases, the system automatically sends an invitation email to the user.

## How Organization Invitations Work

When an organization adds your email:
* You receive an email notification stating that the organization has invited you.
* The email contains information about:

  * The organization name
  * Your assigned role (User or Admin)
  * A link to accept the invitation

If you are not yet registered on the platform, you will be prompted to create an account using the invited email address.

If you already have an account, you can accept the invitation directly after logging in.


## Roles in Organization Invitations

When inviting a user, the organization assigns one of the following roles:

### User

* Can access shared datasets and permitted projects
* Cannot manage other users
* Cannot modify organization-level settings

### Admin

* Can manage users and roles
* Can approve or reject data access requests
* Can configure organization settings
* Has broader visibility across organization assets

**Important:** Admin privileges should only be granted to trusted internal stakeholders.

## Invitations Triggered by Data Access Approval

In some cases, when a data access request is approved, the organization may also grant the requester membership within the organization.

This typically happens when:
* The data is restricted to organization members only
* Ongoing collaboration is required
* Access requires internal-level visibility

When this occurs:
* The user receives an organization invitation email
* Accepting the invitation grants access according to the assigned role
* The user becomes visible in the organization’s user list

## Managing Organization Invitations

Users can manage invitations directly from their account settings.

Go to:

**My Account → Organization Invitations**

In this section, users can:
* View all pending invitations
* See past accepted or declined invitations
* Review assigned roles
* Accept or decline invitations
* Mute invitation notifications

### Muting Organization Invitations

If you no longer wish to receive invitation notifications from a specific organization:

1. Navigate to **My Account → Organization Invitations**

2. Locate the organization

3. Select the **Mute** option

Muting stops future invitation notifications from that organization, but it does not affect:

* Your existing memberships
* Your current access permissions
* Previously accepted invitations

## Best Practices

For Organizations:

* Verify email addresses before sending invitations
* Assign the lowest necessary role
* Periodically review active members

For Users:

* Only accept invitations from trusted organizations
* Review assigned roles carefully
* Keep notification settings updated

This invitation system ensures secure collaboration, controlled access, and transparent organization management within the platform.
