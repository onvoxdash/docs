---

The **Sign In & Security** section allows you to manage your login credentials and strengthen your account protection. Because the platform handles analytics data and eCommerce-related information, maintaining strong security settings is essential.

This section explains each available option and how to use it effectively.

## 1. Email Addresses

In this section, you can manage all email addresses associated with your account.
You can:

* View your **primary email address**
* Add additional email addresses
* Set a different email as your primary address
* Verify newly added email addresses

### Why Verification Is Important

You must verify your email address to:
* Access certain platform features
* Receive system notifications
* Reset your password securely
* Receive project or collaboration updates

If an email is not verified, some functionality may be restricted.

**Best Practice:**
Always keep at least one verified primary email address linked to your account.

## 2. Phone Numbers

Here, you can manage the phone numbers associated with your account.
You can:

* Add or remove phone numbers
* Set a primary phone number
* Use a phone number for password recovery
* Enable security verification via SMS

### Why Add a Phone Number?

Your phone number:
* Adds an additional layer of security
* Helps verify your identity during login
* Supports two-step verification
* Can be used for password resets

It may also help others connect with you if they already have your number. You can control how your phone number is used at any time from your privacy settings.

**Recommendation:**
Add at least one verified phone number for improved account security.

## 3. Change Password

Use this option to update your account password.
To change your password:

1. Enter your current password.
2. Enter your new password.
3. Confirm the new password.
4. Save changes.

### Password Best Practices

For stronger security:
* Use at least 8–12 characters
* Include uppercase and lowercase letters
* Add numbers and special characters
* Avoid using easily guessed words or personal information
* Do not reuse passwords from other platforms

Regularly updating your password reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

## 4. Where You’re Signed In

This section displays all active sessions associated with your account.

You can view detailed information about:
* **Current session**
* Other active sessions
* IP address
* Browser (e.g., Chrome) and operating system version
* Continent
* Country
* Region
* Date and time of access

### Why This Matters

This feature helps you:
* Monitor suspicious activity
* Identify unknown devices
* Track access locations
* Log out of sessions remotely (if available)

If you notice unfamiliar activity, immediately change your password and enable two-step verification.

## 5. Login History

The **Login History** table provides a complete record of your account login attempts.
The table includes:
* Created date
* Device used
* Email address
* Login status (successful or failed)
* IP address
* Location

### Use Cases

Login history helps you:
* Audit account activity
* Investigate unauthorized access attempts
* Maintain compliance in regulated environments
* Improve overall account security awareness

## 6. Two-Step Verification (2FA)

Two-step verification significantly enhances your account security.
When enabled, you must enter a verification code in addition to your password when:
* Signing in on a new device
* Accessing from a new location
* Performing sensitive actions (if applicable)

You can enable two-step verification using:
* Your phone number (SMS verification)
* An authenticator app

### Benefits of Two-Step Verification

* Prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised
* Protects sensitive analytics and eCommerce data
* Adds an extra identity confirmation layer

### Important Note

Enabling two-step verification will:
* Sign you out of all active sessions
* Remove remembered devices
* Revoke access granted to certain partners or services (if applicable)

You will need to sign in again on each device.

**Strongly Recommended:**
Enable two-step verification for maximum account protection.


## 7. Account Management

**Delete Account**
You can permanently delete your account from this section.

**Warning:**
Deleting your account may:
* Remove access to all projects
* Permanently delete associated data
* Revoke shared access
* Remove analytics history

This action is typically irreversible. Make sure to:
* Download any important data
* Transfer project ownership (if applicable)
* Inform collaborators before proceeding

## Security Best Practices Summary

To keep your account secure:
* Use a strong, unique password
* Verify your email and phone number
* Enable two-step verification
* Regularly review login history
* Monitor active sessions
* Log out from unfamiliar devices

By properly configuring your **Sign In & Security** settings, you protect your analytics projects, eCommerce data, and collaborative workflows from unauthorized access.
