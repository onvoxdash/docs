---

The **Access Management** section provides a centralized overview of all data entities you can access or have requested access to.

This page helps you:
* Track your current permissions
* Monitor pending requests
* Review access levels
* Identify expiration dates
* Stay organized across multiple projects

It serves as your personal permission dashboard within the platform.

## What You Can See in Access Management

Each row in the list represents a data entity you are associated with.

For every item, you can view:

**1.** The name of the data item. This may include:
 * Project
 * Vendor
 * Individual
 * Survey
 * Survey Question
 * Dataset
 * Downloadable Content

This helps you quickly identify what type of data you are working with.

**2.** Access Level

Displays your current permission level for that specific entity.

Possible access levels include:

| Access Level     | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**        | Full control, including permission management |
| **Organizer**    | Can manage structure and organization         |
| **Download**     | Can export or download data                   |
| **Viewer**       | Read-only access                              |
| **Catalog**      | Limited browsing access                       |
| **Organization** | Organization-level membership                 |

Your access level determines what actions you can perform.

**3.** Access Granted Date

Displays the date when access was approved.

This is useful for:
* Tracking recent permissions
* Auditing access history
* Confirming approval timelines

**4.** Access Expiration Date

If applicable, this shows when your access will automatically expire.

After expiration:
* Your permissions are removed
* You may need to submit a new access request

This supports temporary collaborations and secure data governance.

# Sorting Options

You can sort the list to quickly organize your view.

Available sorting options include:
* **Alphabetical** — Sort by entity name (A–Z or Z–A)
* **Entity Type** — Group similar data types together
* **Request Date** — Sort by when access was requested
* **Expiration Date** — Identify soon-to-expire permissions
* **Access Level** — Group by permission type

Sorting helps you prioritize tasks, especially when managing many datasets.

## Filtering Options

Filters allow you to narrow the list based on specific criteria.

You can filter by:

### Entity Type

Select one or more types:
* Survey
* SurveyQuestion
* Dataset
* DownloadableContent

Use this when you only want to see a specific category of data.

### Status

Filter based on access state:
* Shared
* Pending
* Granted
* Denied

### Access Level

Filter by your assigned permission level:
* Owner
* Organizer
* Download
* Viewer
* Catalog
* Organization

### Organization

If you belong to multiple organizations, you can filter access by organization.

This helps separate internal data from partner or external collaborations.

### Access Granted Date

Filter based on approval date to:
* Review recently granted access
* Audit historical permissions

### Access Expiration Date

Filter to:
* Identify access that will expire soon
* Renew permissions proactively
* Clean up outdated collaborations

## Using the Search Field

The search bar allows you to quickly locate a specific entity.

You can search by:

* Entity name
* Keyword
* Partial match

## Best Practices

* Regularly review expiring access.
* Remove unnecessary Owner-level permissions.
* Use sorting and filtering to manage large datasets efficiently.
* Re-request access early if expiration is approaching.

The Access Management section ensures full transparency over your data permissions and supports secure, organized collaboration across analytics and eCommerce operations.
