The **Settings** page allows you to customize how date and time information is displayed across the platform.

Adjusting these preferences ensures that reports, dashboards, timestamps, and analytics align with your regional standards and business requirements.

To access this section, go to:

**Account → Settings**

Changes made here apply to your individual account and do not affect other users.

## Date Format

You can choose how dates are displayed throughout the platform.

This affects:
* Dashboard timestamps
* Report exports
* Activity logs
* Access granted and expiration dates
* Data tables

### Available Options (Examples)

* MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., 02/15/2026)
* DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 15/02/2026)
* YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2026-02-15)

Selecting the correct format helps prevent confusion, especially when working with international teams or time-sensitive eCommerce analytics.

**Tip:** If you collaborate globally, consider using the ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for clarity.

## Time Format

You can choose between:
* **12-hour format (AM/PM)**
* **24-hour format**

This setting affects:
* Dashboard activity timestamps
* Report generation times
* Access request logs
* Notification timestamps

Choose the format that matches your regional preference or company standard.

## Time Zone

You can set your preferred time zone to ensure all timestamps reflect your local time.

This setting impacts:
* Data refresh times
* Report scheduling
* Access granted timestamps
* Expiration dates
* User activity logs

For example:

If your organization operates in multiple regions, setting the correct time zone ensures you see analytics and event data relative to your working hours.

**Important:** The system stores timestamps in a standardized format internally. Changing your time zone only affects how times are displayed to you.

## Why These Settings Matter

Correct date and time configuration helps:
* Avoid reporting errors
* Prevent misunderstandings in data analysis
* Align cross-team communication
* Maintain accurate compliance records
